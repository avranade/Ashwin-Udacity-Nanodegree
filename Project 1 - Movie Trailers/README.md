# Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project of the ***Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree*** 
Offered by Udacity 


As part of this project, I had to write python code to create a list of movies (along with their attributes like name, movie poster and a Youtube URL for the trailer), so that a static web page can be created to allow users to browse selection of movies and also watch the trailer
