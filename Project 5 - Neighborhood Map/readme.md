## Project 5 : Neighbourhood Map - Blue Bottle locations in San Francisco
This single page application was created to show a map of locations where Blue Bottle Coffee is available.  

## Frameworks/APIs used
* Knockout JS
* Google Maps
* Foursquare
* JQuery

## Project Overview

* You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## How to View This App
* Clone the repo or download project as zip file
* Once you have the code, navigate to and open index.html

## Notes on editing this app/ Troubleshooting
* In some instances, the error message 'Something went wrong, Foursquare content not available.' might appear. This could be because the API has hit it's limit. 
* In this case, either wait or create your own foursquare client ID and secret on [Foursquare for Developers](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and update client ID and secret in 'application.js' file
* In case you face an issue in Google map not coming up, please create your own Google Map API key and update it in 'index.html'

## Further improvements 
* While the page is currently standalone, it is based on canned data. A further improvement will be getting locations from API calls
* Accessibility text hasn't been added specifically. In terms of Accessibility, this might fail
